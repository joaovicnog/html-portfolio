<h1>The Best Visual Novels According to Yoru</h1>

<h2>My top 3 visual novels of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Dies Irae</h3>
<p>It was the best experience I could have in the media.</p>

<h3>Utawarerumono</h3>
<p>
  I couldn't think of a better example of how to make a main cast so
  enthralling.
</p>

<h3>Full Metal Daemon Muramasa</h3>
<p>This is not a story of heroes.</p>
